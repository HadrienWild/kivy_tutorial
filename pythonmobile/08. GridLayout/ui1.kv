<RootWidget>:
	# GridLayout is similar to the StackLayout 'lr-tb' orientation, but it arranges
	# the widgets as a matrix : each widget within a same row will have the same height
	# and each widget within the same column will have the same width.
	# Unlike the StackLayout where you can size widgets with different heights within
	# a same row or different widths within a same column, you can't do this with a
	# GridLayout : if you manually size some of the widgets so that they break the
	# row/height-column/width rule, they will be forcefully resized so that all their
	# edges are aligned to obtain a matrix pattern.
	#
	# You have to either set a 'rows' amount or a 'cols' (columns) amount, so that the
	# layout automatically arranges the widgets within these limitations, by adding
	# respectively either new columns or new rows.
